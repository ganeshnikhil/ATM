# ATM for Bank

The ATM for Bank is a Python program that simulates an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) system. It allows users to perform various banking operations such as checking account balance, depositing money, withdrawing money, creating new accounts, deleting accounts, and performing transactions between accounts.

## Features

- **Check Account Balance**: Users can check the balance of their accounts, which includes the total amount of money available.

- **Deposit Money**: Users can deposit money into their accounts, increasing the total balance.

- **Withdraw Money**: Users can withdraw money from their accounts, decreasing the total balance, provided they have sufficient funds.

- **Create New Account**: Users can create new bank accounts by providing their name and an initial deposit amount. Each account is assigned a unique ID.

- **Delete Account**: Users can delete their existing accounts, removing them from the system.

- **Perform Transactions**: Users can transfer money from one account to another, enabling them to send money to other account holders.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Run the `atm.py` script in a Python environment.
2. Choose an option from the menu by entering the corresponding number.
3. Follow the prompts and provide the required information.
4. View the results of the selected operation, such as account details, transaction history, or success/failure messages.


## Path of account info file
Account information  path is stored in a JSON file named `path.json`. THE json file stores the path:"" of atm.json file

## Data Storage

## Note

- This ATM system is intended for educational purposes and may not include all the security measures found in real-world banking systems. It lacks features such as user authentication, PIN verification, encryption, and user access controls.
- Exercise caution when using this program in a production environment, as it may require enhancements and additional security measures to meet real-world banking standards.
